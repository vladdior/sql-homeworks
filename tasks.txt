Part I: creating and modifying tables
1. Use flyway to migrate the scripts from src/main/resources/db/migration
2. Add to your first script SQL instructions to insert one row into job_history table.
3. Create table pay with a one-to-one relation to employees
    cardNr(PK)
    salary(transfered from employees)
    commission_pct(transfered from employees)
4. Create table projects with a many-to-many relation to employees
    project_id (PK)
    project_description (constaint: the text length should be greater than 10)
    project_investments
    constraint: value should be greater than 0
    investments should be measured in thousands (the number should end with at least 3 zeros:
        anything less than 500 is 0.
        anything between 500 and 1499 should be 1000,
        anything between 1500 and 2499 should be 2000
        (hint: investigate number data type precision and scale)
    project_revenue
    somewhere should be stored information about amount of hours an employee has been working on a project

Part II: Triggers
1. Trigger creation I
    add department_amount column to locations table
    add comment "Contains the amount of departments in the locationâ€œ
    create a trigger, which will update the amount of departments in locations every time a row is inserted in/deleted from departments
2. Trigger creation II
   create table employment_logs
        employment_log_id
        first_name
        last_name
        employment_action (can be only 'HIRED' or 'FIRED')
        employment_status_updtd_tmstmp
    each time a row is INSERTED INTO or DELETED FROM employees table, corresponding log should be inserted into employment_logs table
    log's insertion should happen inside of a stored procedure
    to think about: What problem would we face, if we add employee_id as FK into employment_logs table?
